    How Good is Your Spanish Really? And would you bet your life on that?

An exploitative publishing company known as [McGraw Hill](http://google.com/search?q=mcgraw+hill+sucks)
(almost as nefarious as the Grande Inquisitor himself), has taken
$50 of mine, basically just for a "key" which allows me access to a
crappy website. My crappy webapp is at least *FREE*.

Plus I wanted to practice my Ruby and try [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org).

Features
--------
* You can endure the inquisition in full (A series of Spanish Vocabulary questions,
  _be careful you don't get too many wrong._).
* You may add new vocabulary terms that become part of the quiz.
* *COMING SOON* (maybe, if I feel like it) points for personal scores.
